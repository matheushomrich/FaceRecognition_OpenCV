# FaceRecognition_OpenCV
Simple face recognition implementation in Python with OpenCV

To run the application you need to have python and OpenCV installed in your device.
Once you have that covered you just need to type "python faceRecognition.py" in the folder with the .xml and the .py file.

If you want to use the application with your camera uncomment line 10, if you want to use it in a video uncomment line 9(you need to have this video downloaded on the same folder and also put the name of it as a parameter for "VideoCapture")
